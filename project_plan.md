  "category": "Percentages",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "question": "If k is increased by 300%, the result is 120. What is the value of k?",
  "options": {
    "A": "30",
    "B": "40",
    "C": "360",
    "D": "480"
  },
  "correctAnswer": "A",
  "explanation": "k(1 + 300/100) = 120, so 4k = 120, therefore k = 30."
}

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

#### Scope Creep
- **Risk:** Additional features requested mid-development
- **Impact:** Timeline delays, budget overrun
- **Mitigation:** Strict change request process, document all requirements upfront

#### Browser Compatibility
- **Risk:** Issues with older browsers
- **Impact:** Additional testing/fixing time
- **Mitigation:** Define browser support early, use polyfills

#### Data Complexity
- **Risk:** Complex question formats (images, equations)
- **Impact:** Additional development time
- **Mitigation:** Clarify question format requirements early

### Dependencies

#### From Client
- Timely feedback on designs (within 3 business days)
